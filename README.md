## Instruction for our project
#### 1. Check the database first,  which is a file called [recipes - Sheet1.csv](https://github.com/CSC207-UofT/course-project-group-069/blob/main/recipes%20-%20Sheet1.csv), since our project has not too much recipes yet in our database, so some random ingredients added in our fridge may be hard to find to recipe.

#### 2. Main codes of our project is in [course-project-group-069/src/main/java/com/example/phase2/com/example/phase2](https://github.com/CSC207-UofT/course-project-group-069/tree/main/src/main/java/com/example/phase2). Each layer of clean architecture is packaged by a file, so when you go through the whole project, you can easily know the layer of the codes. To directly run our code, go to GUI file and run GUI.java.

#### 3. Our tests path is  [course-project-group-069/src/test/java/](https://github.com/CSC207-UofT/course-project-group-069/tree/main/src/main/java/com/example/phase2), two packages including  the entity tests and use case tests, and ControllerPresenterTest is the test for Controller and Presenter.

#### 4. All files contains the doc, so it will be easy to go through the whole project.
